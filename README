A th-threads=posix \
--enable-mpi-thread-multiple \
--without-memory-manager \
--disable-dlopen \
--enable-opal-multi-threadsproject focused on robotic contact-oriented catching of irregular and unwieldy objects on a plane

Setup:
Currently setup is still quite complicated.
Two Packages are required:

-rpi-matlab-simulator
svn checkout http://rpi-matlab-simulator.googlecode.com/svn/simulator/ rpi-matlab-simulator-read-only

for now install in project directory

-OpenMPI
In order to run any of the mpi functionality, a custom build of OpenMPI is likely needed.
Matlab has a thing against dynamic libraries, so some specific compiler options will be
irdd/dd/deequred 

#!/bin/bash
./configure \
--prefix=$PWD/../install \
--with-threads=posix \
--enable-mpi-thread-multiple \
--without-memory-manager \
--disable-dlopen \
--enable-opal-multi-threads

--disable-dlopen appears to be what allows OpenMPI to cooperate with Matlab
